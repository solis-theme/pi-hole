## Usage

Currently, there are only two ways to install this theme:

1. Install via modifying a prebuilt (existing) Pi-hole theme (eg. LCARS which is located at `/var/www/html/admin/style/themes/lcars.css`), 


> **Warning** \
> This way is more tedious but works on all devices, it also **requires** admin access AND it is also dangerous to use because it may break Pi-hole after updates.

2. Install it via Stylus (recommended)

## Installing globally (1st method)

SSH into the the Pi-hole machine and head on into the the `/var/www/html/admin/style` directory and pick a theme to modify, it is totally your choice. After that delete the current contents of the file and paste the contents of the `pi-hole.css` file into the theme file of your choice. Pick the theme in Pi-hole settings and you are done!

## Installing via Stylus (2nd method, recommended)

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lunar-theme/pi-hole/main/pi-hole.user.css"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20with-Stylus-%233281ea" alt="Install with Stylus"/></a>

> **Warning** \
> Your Pi-hole must be located at `pi.hole`, if it isn't the theme wont work and will need manual editing to line 13 to change the domain from `pi.hole` to whatever the address of your Pi-hole is.
